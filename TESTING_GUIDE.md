# 🧪 Testing Guide for Pollstr

## ✅ Build Status
The application builds successfully! The only error is missing environment variables, which is expected.

## 🔧 Setup Required

### 1. Environment Variables
Create `.env.local` file with your Supabase credentials:

```bash
# .env.local
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=https://your-project.supabase.co
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your-anon-key-here
```

### 2. Get Your Supabase Credentials
1. Go to your Supabase project dashboard
2. Navigate to Settings → API
3. Copy the Project URL and anon/public key

## 🚀 Testing Steps

### 1. Start Development Server
```bash
npm run dev
```

### 2. Test Authentication
1. **Register**: Go to `/auth/register`
   - Create a new account
   - Should redirect to `/polls` after success

2. **Login**: Go to `/auth/login`
   - Sign in with existing account
   - Should redirect to `/polls` after success

3. **Navigation**: Check that user info appears in navigation

### 3. Test Poll Creation
1. **Create Poll**: Go to `/create-poll`
   - Fill out poll form (requires login)
   - Should redirect to `/polls` after creation

2. **Form Validation**: Test validation
   - Try submitting empty form
   - Try with only 1 option
   - Try with short question/description

### 4. Test Poll Viewing
1. **Poll List**: Go to `/polls`
   - Should show all polls from database
   - Should show poll details (title, description, creator, date)

2. **Individual Poll**: Click on any poll
   - Should show full poll details
   - Should show voting interface

### 5. Test Voting System
1. **Vote**: Select an option and vote
   - Should show success message
   - Should show results with vote counts and percentages

2. **Duplicate Vote**: Try voting again
   - Should show error message
   - Should prevent duplicate voting

3. **Results View**: After voting
   - Should show progress bars
   - Should show vote counts and percentages

## 🐛 Common Issues

### Environment Variables Not Set
- **Error**: "supabaseUrl is required"
- **Solution**: Create `.env.local` with your Supabase credentials

### Database Connection Issues
- **Error**: Network errors or authentication failures
- **Solution**: Check your Supabase URL and anon key

### RLS Policy Issues
- **Error**: "Row Level Security" errors
- **Solution**: Make sure you ran the complete SQL schema
